# Task for biotics.ai

- Backend is in progress
- Frontend is still an empty template.

Backend has its own Dockerfile
Frontend has its own Dockerfile
The whole project has a docker-compose file


The frontend Dockerfile is not working at the moment, at least here, which means the compose won't work as well because of some bundling bugs.
I stopped working to waste no more time since I mentioned it will be in this time range.


However, dockerfiles are still provided to make sure you review them.

There are 3 README.md files, this one, the frontend/README.md & backend/README.md
